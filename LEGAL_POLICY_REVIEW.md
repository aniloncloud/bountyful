export function TrustBadges() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 items-center justify-center py-8">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 rounded-lg">
        <ShieldCheckIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-green-600" />
        <span className="text-sm font-medium">GDPR Compliant</span>
      </div>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 rounded-lg">
        <LockClosedIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-600" />
        <span className="text-sm font-medium">256-bit Encryption</span>
      </div>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 bg-purple-50 dark:bg-purple-900/20 rounded-lg">
        <CheckBadgeIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-purple-600" />
        <span className="text-sm font-medium">PCI DSS Compliant</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### 3. Enhanced Food Safety Disclaimer

#### Current Issue:
Food liability disclaimer is buried in Terms. Users might miss it.

#### Recommendation: Add Prominent Acknowledgment

Add to checkout flow:

```tsx
// src/components/FoodSafetyAcknowledgment.tsx
export function FoodSafetyAcknowledgment() {
  const [acknowledged, setAcknowledged] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="p-4 bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800 rounded-lg">
      <div className="flex gap-3">
        <ExclamationTriangleIcon className="h-6 w-6 text-yellow-600 flex-shrink-0" />
        <div>
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">
            Food Safety Notice
          </h4>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-3">
            Magic Bags contain surplus food prepared by independent restaurants.
            Contents vary daily based on availability. If you have food allergies
            or dietary restrictions, please verify ingredients with the restaurant
            before consuming.
          </p>
          <label className="flex items-start gap-2 cursor-pointer">
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={acknowledged}
              onChange={(e) => setAcknowledged(e.target.checked)}
              className="mt-1"
            />
            <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              I understand that Bountyful is a platform connecting me with restaurants,
              and that restaurants are solely responsible for food preparation and safety.
            </span>
          </label>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Add "Why We Need This Data" Explanations

#### Current Issue:
Privacy Policy lists data collected but could better explain WHY.

#### Enhancement: Add Purpose Badges

```markdown
### 2.3 Location Data

**Why we collect this:** To show you restaurants near you and calculate pickup times

**What we collect:**
- Approximate location (city-level)
- Precise location (when you allow it)

**You're in control:**
- ✅ Turn off anytime in device settings
- ✅ Use app with approximate location only
- ✅ Manually enter address instead

**We use location to:**
1. 📍 Show nearby restaurants (primary purpose)
2. 📏 Calculate distances and travel times
3. 📊 Improve service coverage in your area
4. 🔔 Send location-based pickup reminders (optional)

**We DON'T:**
- ❌ Track your location in the background
- ❌ Share your location with advertisers
- ❌ Sell location data to third parties
```

---

### 5. Add User Data Dashboard

#### Recommendation: Transparency Dashboard

Create a page showing users exactly what data you have:

```tsx
// src/app/(app)/privacy-dashboard/page.tsx
'use client';

export default function PrivacyDashboard() {
  return (
